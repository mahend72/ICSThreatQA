# ICSThreatQA: Knowledge-Graph Enhanced QA for ICS Threat Intelligence

This repository contains the implementation of **ICSThreatQA**, a knowledge-graph–enhanced Question Answering (QA) framework for **Industrial Control System (ICS)** threat intelligence.

ICSThreatQA turns static threat knowledge (e.g., **[MITRE ATT&CK for ICS](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/)**) into an **interactive QA system** that helps analysts with:

- Threat detection  
- Incident response  
- Mapping logs/events to ATT&CK techniques  
- Multi-hop reasoning over ICS-specific TTPs
